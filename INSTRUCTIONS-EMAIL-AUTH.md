# Enabling Email/Password Authentication in Firebase

To allow users to sign up and log in with their email and password, you need to enable this sign-in method in your Firebase project console.

## Steps to Enable

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console**: Open your project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2.  **Navigate to Authentication**: In the left-hand navigation menu, go to **Build > Authentication**.

3.  **Go to the "Sign-in method" Tab**: Click on the **Sign-in method** tab from the top navigation bar.

4.  **Select Email/Password**: From the list of sign-in providers, find and click on **Email/Password**.

5.  **Enable the Provider**:
    *   Toggle the switch to **Enable** the Email/Password sign-in provider.
    *   You can leave the "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" option disabled unless you plan to use it.

6.  **Save Changes**: Click the **Save** button.

That's it! Your application is now configured to accept user registrations and logins using an email and password.
